## Participation Data

Participants of a tournament are normally required to provide some participation related data to the organisers. e.g. arrival and departure time, dietary preferences, etc.

Depending on your role in the tournament, everyone has to provide this information under [**Registration - My Data**](/registration/data).

Team leaders have an overview of the data for each member of their team.
